This folks, is our first actual look at what is rumored to be the brand new Nexus 7 from Google. We’re not exactly sure what they’ll be calling their new Android 4.3 Jelly Bean powered tablet, but the long wait has finally come to an end. Today an entire gallery of images have leaked along with a blurrycam video, and we’re seeing the upgraded and improved Nexus 7 2 for the first time.

Recent reports have been mixed regarding the overall hardware under the hood, and that still seems to be up in the air at the moment. We’ve been reporting a late July release for months, and so far everything appears to be right on track for that. Google’s even got an event scheduled for July 24th where we’ll likely get the details “officially” about this new slate.

Today we saw leaked photos of retail stock screens showing this being called the Nexus 2 7″, but I’m going with Nexus 7 2 until we hear otherwise. So what’s new? Aside from having a slimmer package overall and a much thinner side bezel (thank you) we have seriously improved specs across the board. The 7-inch display is now 1920 x 1080p, and the processor is being reported as a Snapdragon S4 Pro quad-core (not the 600) along with 2GB of RAM, and the device will come in 16 and 32GB storage options.

The images show a slightly redesigned unit from ASUS along with a thinner machine, a rear facing 5 megapixel camera, dual speakers, and micro-USB for charging and syncing. The overall shape, design, and button location all remains similar to last years model, and this thing actually looks pretty awesome. I can’t wait to get my hands on one.

The leakster reveals there is an upper and lower speaker for better sound, dual cameras, and reported that Android 4.3 Jelly Bean is in fact on board. Which means we’ll probably be learning more about that soon too. Engadget is reporting the new slate will hit retail shelves like Office Max starting next week, probably on the 25th right after Google’s announcement, so at this point we’re really just days away.

Obviously these photos could indeed be fake, but things are looking pretty good right about now for all you potential buyers. I’ll be snagging the 32GB for $269 the minute it’s available, and we’re hearing the 16GB model will be $229 as well. Get excited folks!

Android Centralは17日(米国時間)、独占情報として、米グーグルが来週24日にも発表するとみられる新型「Nexus 7」の本体写真とビデオを掲載しています。

新型Nexus 7は従来モデルからデザインが変更されており、従来モデルと印象が大きく異なります。画像を見る限りではベゼルは比較的太めですが、コスト増加を抑える目的があるのでしょうか。なお、画面サイズは従来と同じく7インチ。

新型Nexus 7は500万画素の背面カメラを新たに搭載し、カメラモジュールの製造は中国Chiconyが担当。従来モデルではコストダウンのために省かれていたものですが、今回は背面カメラの搭載を決めたようです。上画像を見る限りではかなり大きなレンズを搭載している様子が見て取れます。

それにしても、グーグルがこの端末にかける “本気度” が伝わってきます。ライバル機種にあたるiPad miniは苦戦を強いられるかもしれません。なお、前面カメラは120万画素(台湾LITEONMOBILE製)。

背面には「nexus」の文字と、各種スペックが記されたラベルが貼り付けられています。製造元はASUSで、「ME571K_PR1_SKU2」とのモデルナンバーが記されています。SKU2ということなので、仕様が異なるSKU1が存在する可能性もあります。

プロセッサはクアルコム製のSnapdragon S4 Pro APQ8064。当該モデルはWi-Fi専用モデルとみられていますが、仮にLTE対応モデルが存在した場合はSnapdragon 600シリーズのプロセッサを搭載している可能性があります。

メインメモリはDDR3Lの4GB。スマートフォンなどで一般的な2GBではなく、まさかの4GB搭載となりました。なお、内蔵ストレージは16GB～32GBの選択制が予想されています。

内蔵スピーカーは2つ存在。本体を横に持った際、左右に分かれるように配置されており、ステレオ効果があるものとみられます。

動作しているAndroid OSのバージョンは「Android 4.3」。従来にはない宇宙を模したような壁紙と、PINコード入力用ダイヤラーが存在ます(ロック解除のため)。

= Exclusive first look: Pics and video of the new Nexus 7

The new Nexus 7 sports an updated look, adds a rear camera

Here we go, folks. The first probable  pictures of what we believe is the long-awaited successor to the Nexus 7. We've had to do a little Photoshop surgery to protect the source (we'll just call the source, oh, how about "Brett"), but what we're seeing lines up with rumored specs, and what we'd expect to see in the follow-up.

Separately, we've gotten a look at some possible pricing, giving some hope that we might finally soon see the retail release of Google's affordable tablet. And then there's the Google event set for July 24 in San Francisco.

Ready for more? Read on.

First, a quick caveat: Ain't nothing official yet. Google's not announced anything, and we have no idea if what we see here is a finished product, or prototype. (When in doubt, I usually assume the latter.) And we've seen things change greatly from early leaks to retail release before, including with the original Nexus 7. We're also not 100 percent confident in the specs that accompanied this thing. So, grain of salt and all that, until official things are official.

Hell, we don't even know what it'll be called.

But what we're looking at here is labeled as the ME571K_PR1_SKU2, again manufactured by ASUS. It should be one of (at least) two versions of the Nexus 7 successor — we're expecting 16- and 32-gigabyte options, and it's probably safe to assume we'll see Wifi-only versions as well as models with cellular data connections.

The specs slapped onto this little lost tablet include the expected 7-inch LCD display and, new this time around, a pair of cameras. There's a 1.2-megapixel shooter from LITEONMOBILE on the front, and 5-megapixel camera by Chicony on the back. The rear camera appears to be situated in the same corner as the 3.5mm headphone jack.

The listed motherboard points to Qualcomm's APQ8064 with a Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro processor. That's different than the Snapdragon 600 that the Bluetooth Special Interest Group thought it saw, but stranger discrepancies have happened — and it's entirely possible that there are two versions of this thing out there. Remember that this is SKU2, according to the specs listed on it. The FCC, however, has already seen a Snapdragon S4 tablet come through.

We're also possibly looking at a ridiculously whopping 4 gigabytes of DDR3L RAM. (Though we're not 100 percent sure on that, 2GB wouldn't surprise us at all, and, again, written specs on stuff like this get messed up all the time.) We're also expecting the aforementioned (and not at all surprising) 16- and 32-gigabyte storage options.

Looks like microUSB is still the preferred method of plugging in, and it's centered in the bottom edge of the tablet. (For what it's worth, this is one of those areas in which we saw drastic changes between prototype and finished product in the original Nexus 7.) The power button and volume rocker are situated the same way as they are on the current Nexus 7. 

One other addition — and this is one you can't see too well in these pictures— is the dual speakers, referred to in the specs here as "upper" and "lower" speakers. They're positioned on the rear of the tablet, with one near the USB port.

On the software side, we're told this unit had Android 4.3 on board. Not a real surprise there, especially with Google doing something next week in San Francisco. But it also wouldn't surprise us to see a 4.2.2 launch and an quick update immediately thereafter. Either way, it's got the same old lock screen widgets we're used to. (We've seen a phone dialer as well, but we wouldn't read too much into that just yet.)

Edit: On second thought, that's the lock screen PIN entry we're seeing, not a dialer. Thanks, zachavm.

Big ups to "Brett" for the info!
